vivo profiling of site-specific human cancer cell states in zebrafish\nAbstract\nTissue microenvironments affect the functional states of cancer cells, but determining these influences in vivo has remained a significant challenge.","We present a quantitative high-resolution imaging assay of cancer cell morphology in zebrafish xenografts to probe functional adaptation to variable cell extrinsic cues and molecular interventions.","We focus on Ewing Sarcoma, a pediatric cancer driven by a single oncogenic fusion protein EWSR1-FLI1, and with little to no additional somatic mutations, making it a prototypical form of cancer whose adaptation to microenvironments is likely driven by acute, non-genomic mechanisms.","Using computer vision analysis of 3D cell shapes, we find systematic shifts in the distribution of cell morphotypes between distinct sites in the fish embryo.","We also find site-specific morphological responses to differential expression of EWSR1-FLI1.","Combining these data we propose a model where Ewing Sarcoma cancer cell plasticity is sensitive both to expression fluctuation of EWSR1-FLI1 and signals from the surrounding tissue microenvironment, with either or both factors possibly contributing to the oncogenic potential of these cells.","Introduction\nMetastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths [1].","The ability of metastatic cancer cells to arrive, survive and thrive in diverse tissue microenvironments (MEs) is a testament to their adaptability.","Despite decades of research, our understanding of the mechanisms of metastasis has many remaining gaps, making this the single biggest obstacle to successful cancer treatment [1, 2].","Among the open questions on metastasis is the identification and systematic probing of the functional adaptation of cancer cells to specific tissue microenvironments.","Historically, cancer research has predominantly relied on the mouse for investigation of organotropic behaviors [3].","However, for the task of probing functional adaptation of cancer cells in different tissue environments, this model has several limitations.","Cellular responses are dynamic and heterogeneous, and meaningful functional plasticity is super-imposed by cell-to-cell variation that is unrelated to organotropic processes.","Statistical distinction of these sources of cellular heterogeneity require a large pool of single cell measurements in the intact cellular microenvironment, which is nearly impossible to accomplish in the mouse.","Moreover, the mouse does not provide easy access for live cell imaging in most organs, limiting the diversity of microenvironments that can be studied.","As an alternative, 2D and 3D cell culture have been exploited for studying cancer cell heterogeneity [4, 5], but these systems lack the relevant micro-environmental complexity of an organism for understanding functional adaptation.","Here, we propose human cancer cell xenografts in zebrafish larvae as a powerful compromise between the competing quests for environmental diversity, experimental access, and sufficient throughput to acquire meaningful descriptions of cancer cell adaptation [5\u20138]: (1) Zebrafish larvae contain various complex tissue microenvironments, with tissue mechanics, physiology, and disease susceptibility that is highly conserved with those of humans [6, 9].","(2) The optical transparency of zebrafish grants convenient experimental access to any metastatic site by high-resolution imaging, and (3) a single experimental session can yield data from numerous sites and xenografts, allowing statistically properly powered comparative studies.","This work sets the stage for development of human cancer xenografts in zebrafish as a model for unraveling mechanisms of cell adaptation during tumor progression and metastasis.","As an initial readout of plastic cell behaviors, we focus on cell morphological variation.","Cell morphology is the integrated response of cells to autonomous cues [10\u201315], mechanical and chemical interactions with the microenvironment [16\u201318], as well as a functional proxy for proliferation and cell death [19, 20].","Accordingly, pathologists have relied for decades on morphological patterns to stratify cancer disease states and to deliver specific diagnoses that guide treatment.","With the recent development of machine learning, cell morphology is emerging as an increasingly quantitative correlate to particular molecular cell states [12, 21\u201325].","Studying cancer cell adaptation is of particular importance in pediatric cancers.","While somatic variation, clonal heterogeneity and selection are thought to drive adaptation during metastasis of several adult cancers [26], many pediatric cancers exhibit a very low mutational burden beyond a single driving mutation [27, 28].","This suggests that non-genetic mechanisms may dominate the process of cell adaptation.","In this work, we focus specifically on Ewing Sarcoma (EwS) as a pediatric cancer prototype.","EwS is the second most common pediatric bone tumor, characterized by a chromosomal translocation fusing members of the FUS\/EWSR1\/TAF15 family to ETS transcription factors, the most common of which creates the EWSR1-FLI1 (EF1) fusion oncogene [29, 30].","As with most other pediatric sarcomas[31], presence of metastasis is by far the most prominent adverse prognostic factor in EwS [29].","The specific tissue environment appears to play a key role in the degree of malignancy in EwS [32\u201335], as well as other pediatric sarcomas [36, 37].","For example, pelvic primary tumors appear to correlate with poorer prognosis and are more prone to metastasis compared to other primary sites, and patients who have metastasis only to lung have improved survival compared to those with metastasis to bone or bone marrow [32].","Thus, we assembled a quantitative high-resolution imaging assay of EwS cell morphology in xenografts to probe the morphological variation as a proxy to functional adaptation in diverse microenvironments and experimental molecular interventions.","Applying in house-written computer vision pipelines to 3D cell shape analysis, we found systematic shifts in the distribution of cell morphological states between seeding sites in the fish embryo, as well as between control expression and knockdown of EWSR1-FLI1 in an environmentally sensitive fashion.","We also found that proliferative but not apoptotic states of EwS cells differed between the tissue microenvironments.","We propose a model where EwS cancer cell plasticity is sensitive both to fluctuations of EWSR1-FLI1 and signals from the surrounding tissue microenvironment, with either or both of these factors possibly contributing to metastatic potential.","Design\n3D shape analysis captures functional heterogeneity in Ewing Sarcoma cells\nWe present an experimental and analytical pipeline to identify single-cell morphologies within tissues of zebrafish larvae and identify differences in morphological cell states (Figure 1).","By analysis of geometric features extracted from high-resolution 3D image volumes, we examined morphological heterogeneity as a function of cell type, oncogene expression level, and tissue microenvironment.","To allow single cell segmentation and shape analysis, mixtures of cells tagged with either a red-emitting (90-99% of cell mixture), or a green-emitting filamentous actin marker F-Tractin (1-10% of cell mixture) were injected into 2-day old zebrafish larvae at one of three seeding sites: the hindbrain ventricle (HBV), perivitelline space (PVS), and, by rapid passive transport during injection, the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT).","This allowed us to investigate morphological and functional adaptation of cell population to distinct microenvironments.","For example, the HBV are cavities which contain cerebrospinal fluid, rich in hormones, proteoglycans, and ions [38\u201340], the PVS is a sandwiched, avascular region between two malleable membranes surrounding the yolk [41] and the CHT is a compact, thin, crowded region containing multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, stromal cell and hematopoietic cells for which it serves as a stem cell niche [42\u201344].","We present an experimental and analytical pipeline to identify single-cell morphologies within tissues of zebrafish larvae and identify differences in morphological cell states by computer-vision analysis of 3D cell shape, as follows.","(1) In order to distinguish shapes of individual cells, we prepared a mosaic cell mixture consisting of 90-99% of cells labeled with a green-emitting fluorophore and 1-10% of cells labeled with a red-emitting fluorophore, or vice versa.","We then injected the cell mixture into the Perivitelline space (PVS) or Hindbrain Ventricle (HBV) of 2-day-old zebrafish larvae.","For PVS injections, we selected specifically for injected larvae which also have xenografted cells in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) immediately following injection.","Fish larvae were fixed at 3 days post fertilization (dpf) and imaged using an Axially Swept Light Sheet Microscope (ASLM), which is optimized for maximum throughput, resolution, and flexibility of sample orientation.","High axial resolution is obtained by combining a thin, moving light-sheet with a synchronized rolling shutter (active pixels) that blocks out of focus fluorescence on the image plane on an sCMOS Camera.","(2) Individual cells were computationally extracted from the image data of sparsely labeled cells, which after image processing are segmented into 3D volumes.","We then measured 12 global 3D geometric features as listed, and each cell was indexed according to fish, location, and cell type.","(3) Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we captured the heterogeneity of morphological cell states (N=number of fish, n=number of cells).","PC1 captured the protrusive state of the cell, while PC2 was influenced largely by volume (insets).","We evaluated our analytical pipeline and used several visualization and classification techniques to capture differences among heterogeneous single-cell data.","24 hours following injection, chemically fixed zebrafish larvae were mounted in 1% low-melting agarose in Fluorinated Ethylene propylene (FEP) tubes, which allows for rotation of the sample in order to optimize the imaging conditions at the sites of interest.","Images within the three seeding sites were acquired using an Axially Swept Light-sheet Microscope (ASLM) [45, 46], which is a high-resolution modality of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) that offers near-isotropic resolution over large sampling volumes.","Isotropic resolution is essential for an unbiased analysis of 3D cell geometry [12].","For the presented study we imaged ~190 fish larvae.","After semi-automated image processing to identify image sub-volumes containing cells suitable for shape analysis (see Methods), we extracted the volumes of ~640 individual cells using a tailored version of an automated segmentation pipeline developed previously [12].","Each computationally defined surface was visually inspected to eliminate segmentation artifacts.","The final dataset encompassed ~350 validated cell volumes from ~140 fish.","For each volume, we measured 12 geometric features (Figure 1, Table S1).","To test for batch effects, we calculated the median values of each feature per fish (Figure S1a).","While the geometric features showed substantial variance, even within bins that distinguish cell type, oncogene expression and seeding site, the variance of the features among fish was decreased, suggesting that batch effects across larvae are modest.","Significant shifts between bins, even for a single feature at the fish level, indicate that cell type, molecular condition, and seeding site play a role in the control of cell morphogenesis.","To capture differences in the morphology states of bins we switched to multivariate analysis of the complete feature sets.","Pairwise comparisons of individual features such as sphericity and volume could not distinguish many cell types or molecular states (Figure S1b).","To visualize and reduce the dimensionality of the 12-dimensional feature space we applied principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure 1).","The first two principal components (PCs) captured 86% of the heterogeneity within the data, indicating a high-level potential for dimensionality reduction of the feature space (Figure S1c).","Indeed, PC1 and PC2 together captured morphological differences between all cell types and molecular conditions (Figure S1d).","As a negative control we also compared WT cells to cells of the same type expressing scrambled shRNA vectors and found no difference between the conditions.","We wondered which geometric properties were most important for a EwS cell morphology analysis.","To address this, we projected the unit vectors of the twelve individual features into the (PC1, PC2)-space.","PC1 was dominated by Sphericity and Aspect Ratio, thus capturing the protrusive state of the cell.","PC2 was dominated by Volume and Surface Area, thus capturing the size and rectangularity of a cell (Figure S1e).","Together, these outcomes led us to conclude that a 2D linear projection of the original feature space would be sufficient for the analysis of meaningful morphological differences between EwS cells.","Results\nEwS cell morphologies are different from fibroblasts and differ between cell lines\nEquipped with the described pipeline, we examined single cell morphologies of two patient-derived Ewing Sarcoma cell lines, TC32 and TC71, in situ in zebrafish larvae (Figure 2a).","We further included analysis of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts as a reference of non-transformed cells.","Previous work in 2D cell culture reported strong morphological changes in response to knock-down of EF1 gene expression, which were also accompanied by shifts in proliferation but not in cell survival [47].","Therefore, we wondered whether EF1 expression changes would trigger similar responses in our in situ 3D imaging system.","To accomplish this, we injected TC32 Ewing sarcoma cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible scrambled (C shRNA) or EF1 (EF1 shRNA) targeting shRNA and cytoplasmic GFP tag and with (1-10%) or without (90-99%) ubiquitously driven F-Tractin-MRuby2.","Visual inspection of 3D renderings of segmented cells already showed distinct differences between NIH-3T3 and EwS cells, and between cells with wild-type or knockdown levels of EF1 expression, pooled from all three tissue MEs (Figure 2b).","Projection of the data into the (PC1,PC2) space confirmed the visual impression of strong morphological shifts between these cell types and conditions (Figure 2c,d).","(a, left) EwS (a, TC71 and TC32) or fibroblast (a, NIH-3T3) cells expressing FTractin-GFP (green in upper panel, grey in lower panel) or FTractin-mRuby2 (red), in zebrafish HBV (3dpf).","(a, right) TC32 cells expressing a doxycycline-induced cassette which includes a cytoplasmic GFP (upper panel, green) as well as (scrambled shRNA (C shRNA) or shRNA targeting EF1 (EF1 shRNA).","A subset of cells also express FTractin-mRuby2 (red in upper panel, grey in lower panel), allowing for sparse labeling of single cell morphologies.","(b) 10 representative 3D cell renderings are displayed within each experimental group, pooled from all three tissue MEs.","Note the distinction in cell shape and size particularly in NIH-3T3 (left-most panel) and TC32 EF1 shRNA (right-most panel) compared to other experimental groups.","(c-d) PCA of all experimental groups shown individually (c) or together (d).","(e) K-means based clustering allows visualization of relationships between experimental groups.","Note distinctions in all experimental groups.","Scale bars 20\u03bcm.","To better reflect the variation of cell shapes, we visualized differences between bins by assigning cells to one of four characteristic clusters in (PC1,PC2) space.","We identified the clusters by K-means and determined the number k of clusters subject to maximizing the silhouette score in the range [3, 10] clusters (Figure 2e).","Clusters 4, 3, and 2 break the data set primarily along the PC1 axis, representing increasingly more protrusive cell shapes, respectively.","Cluster 1 is characterized by a shift in PC2, representing larger, more rectangular cells.","Comparison of the cluster assignments demonstrates stark differences between cell types.","Fibroblasts are heterogeneous, with sampling of all four clusters.","In contrast, TC71 cells dominate Cluster 1, while TC32 cells predominantly occupy Clusters 3 and 4.","TC32 cells with a knock-down of EF1 expression displayed an increase in occupancy of Clusters 2 and 3, at the expense of Cluster 4 occupancy, i.e.","lower EF1 expression overall yields more protrusive cells.","This observation is consistent with 2D cell culture studies describing the cells with EF1 knock-down as more \u2018mesenchymal\u2019 [47].","Of note, exclusion of NIH-3T3 as an outlier group resulted in only a minor shift in PCA space and relative contribution of features (Figure S1f), suggesting that the PCA of the 12 global 3D features constitutes a robust space for the definition of cell morphological classes and is not dominated by the fibroblast distribution.","Overall, these results demonstrate the applicability of 3D cell shape analysis in capturing differences across cell types and experimental conditions, and demonstrate that EF1 oncogene levels affect EwS cell morphology in vivo.","Tissue microenvironment affects EwS cell morphology and function\nIn order to examine whether EwS cells functionally adapt to the tissue ME, we first compared proliferation and cell death states between HBV, PVS, and CHT (Figure 3a) by immunostaining for the proliferative marker Phospho-Histone 3 (PH3) or the apoptotic marker TUNEL (Figure 3b-c), or by measuring change in cluster size over 4 days (S2a-c).","While apoptosis was similarly low across all three tissue MEs (less than 10% on average, Figure 3d), proliferation and growth rates were higher in PVS compared to the other sites (Figure 3e, Figure S2d).","Note that the number of cells greatly varied between regions (Figure S2e), a difference that likely arose from differences in initial seeding rather than cell growth.","However, no clear correlation was seen between proliferation rate and cluster size (Figure S2f) or fold growth and initial cluster size (Figure S2a-c), suggesting cluster size may not be a major driver of differences in cell growth.","(a) Comparison of single cell morphologies were made as a function of seeding site within the zebrafish larvae, each representing a distinct tissue ME.","The hindbrain ventricle (HBV) is a mostly fluid-filled compartment (a), the perivitelline space is a small, compressed region sandwiched between two membranes surrounding the yolk, and the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) is a narrow region rich in vasculature.","(b-c) TC71 cells expressing nuclear marker mCherry-H2B (red), within the HBV (inset, enlarged in b\u2019), CHT (inset, enlarged in c\u2019), or PVS (inset, enlarged in c\u2019\u2019), of fish larvae (4dpf).","Fish are immunostained for proliferation marker PH3 (blue) and apoptotic staining TUNEL (green).","Measurements are made on 3D volumes, as rendered in c\u2019\u2019\u2019.","(d-e) Apoptotic rate is similarly low across all three regions (d), while proliferation rate appears to be highest in PVS compared to other regions (e).","Scale bars 100 \u03bcm (b,c) and 20 \u03bcm (b\u2019-c, c\u201d).","We next examined single cell morphological state variations between distinct tissue MEs (Figure 4).","Bagplots (i.e.","bivariate boxplots) [48] enabled visualization of differences in bin distributions in the PC space.","Differences were further quantified by assembly of similarity matrices based on pairwise permutation tests between regions.","Examination of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts revealed highly heterogeneous cell morphologies, with largely overlapping distributions in all three seeding sites, suggesting that these non-transformed cells lack sensitivity to environmental cues (Figure 4a).","In contrast, the EwS cell lines TC32 (Figure 4b) and TC71 (Figure 4c) showed some distinction in the distributions of cell morphologies as a function of seeding site.","For example, TC32 cells in the PVS and CHT were largely overlapping, but cells in the HBV shifted to the upper left in PC space, representing more protrusive, larger cells.","TC71 cell distributions in the PVS and HBV shifted left in PC space compared to CHT (Figure 4c), suggesting that these cells stayed more rounded in the CHT.","Importantly, the two EwS cell lines displayed differential adaptation patterns to these seeding sites indicating that their oncogenic transformations yield distinct tissue-specific specialization programs.","(a-c) 10 representative cell renderings of EwS cell lines TC32 and TC71 and fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 are shown, color-coded by k-means-based cluster from Figure 2e (black frames, upper part of panels).","Bagplots below display PCA of each cell line as a function of region (HBV-red, PVS, black, CHT, white).","The inner polygon is constructed on the basis of Tukey depth, and contains at most 50% of the data points.","The outer circle encompasses all data excluding outliers.","White plus sign represents the Tukey depth median.","Lower right panel shows a similarity matrix based on pairwise permutation tests.","Note that relative to NIH-3T3 which shows high similarity in morphological cell state among all three regions (a), TC32 (b) and TC71 (c) show some tissue-dependent specialization of cells.","Scale bars: 20 \u03bcm.","Common to both TC32 and TC71 cell lines is the tendency to become more protrusive in the HBV.","This was unexpected, given that the fluid-filled HBV compartment is likely softer than PVS and CHT, and thus is a mechanical environment usually associated with rounded cells [18].","On the other hand, this environment may be enriched in signaling cues that trigger neural differentiation [38, 39].","Closer examination of the architecture of this region revealed that EwS cell clusters within the HBV organized in pseudorosette-like spheroids, with protrusions pointing inwards and cell bodies occupying the cluster periphery (Figure 5a-c, Movie S1).","Notably, pseudorosettes have been described clinically in a subset of Ewing sarcomas classified previously as peripheral Primitive Neuroectordermal tumors (ppNETs) [49\u201351], so named by pathologists according to their apparent neural-like differentiation [52].","Indeed, direct apposition of H&E stains of a human EwS tumor in soft tissue (Figure 5d) and TC71 cells expressing the fluorescent marker Cherry-H2B (Figure 5e) showed a striking similarity in the circular arrangement of nuclei associated with the formation of pseudorosettes.","As expected, based on the cell morphological classification, these arrangements could not be observed with TC71 nuclei in the PVS or CHT (Figure S3a).","In sum, these analyses demonstrate that a morphological classifier is a valid step towards the discovery of cell functional adaptation to MEs.","They also show remarkable parallels between adaptive processes in human tissue and zebrafish, further validating the zebrafish model as a tool for studying organotropism of cancer cells.","(a) schematic of mixtures of flourescently labeled cells displaying pseudo-rosette-like formations formed by EwS cells specifically in hindbrain

dominant shape features, Volume (g) and Sphericity (h).","While no clear relationship can be uncoupled from tissue ME for volume, a few embedded cells but not other groups show cells with distinctly
